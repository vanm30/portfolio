        Welcome to my portfolio! Iâ€™m mostly a web developer, but I currently
        work as a system/software engineer and UI designer on a rail
        communication system. I started as a tester, writing component tests,
        but now I also work on a distribution service, CI/CD, integrating and
        also do UI/UX here. <br />I have about 2-3 years of experience in this
        field.
